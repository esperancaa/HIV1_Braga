#  Molecular Epidemiological Characterization of HIV in the Portuguese Population

This repository contains the code, methodology, and structure for the research project carried out as part of the Biochemistry Bachelor's degree internship, titled “Molecular Epidemiological Characterization of HIV in the Portuguese Population.”

## About the Project
The main goal of this project was to characterize HIV-1 subtypes and identify active transmission clusters in the Minho region, focusing on data collected from patients at Hospital de Braga. Through phylogenetic analysis and the detection of resistance mutations, this study contributes to a better understanding of the local HIV epidemic and its evolution.

## Methodology
Analysis of 131 HIV-1 sequences.

Subtyping using REGA, COMET, and SNAPPy tools.

Phylogenetic tree construction with PhyML.

Transmission cluster identification.

Drug resistance mutation (DRM) profiling: NRTI, NNRTI, PI.

## Ethical Notice
Important Note:
The genetic sequences used in this study were obtained from clinical records at Hospital de Braga. Due to ethical and privacy concerns, the original raw data cannot be made publicly available in this repository. All data were anonymized and used under the approval of the hospital’s ethics committee. Any attempt to replicate these results must be done using synthetic or independent data.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

MAFFT

PhyML

REGA Subtyping Tool

Snakemake (optional)

BioPython

## Key Findings
Predominant subtypes: G, B, A1, C, F1, CRF02_AG.

17 transmission clusters identified.

Evidence of V179E resistance mutation transmission in Portugal.

Subtype A1 shows signs of expansion in the region.
